Guide to use virtual_library.js

The program was coded in VScode. The program can be accessed and controlled through the terminal.

1. Go to File -> Open Folder -> Open the folder where the .js file is located.
2. Open a new terminal and type in "node virtual_library.js". This will display the data of the library and at the bottom will show every command you can take.
3. For the purposes of the assignment, I had randomly selected books through random generation and used placeholder names for the users.
4. For the program to function, it requires Node.js installed.(It's a javascript runtime enviroment.)
